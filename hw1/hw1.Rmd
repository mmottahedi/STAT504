__Problem 1__ (16 points). Which scale of measurement is most appropriate
for the following variables?
(a) Treatment group (treatment or control) in a clinical trial?

answer: Binary variable.

(b) Age range in a clinical trial?

answer: Interval variables.

(c) Geographic location (North America, Southeast Asia, Europe)?

answer: Nominal.

(d) Michelin stars?

answer: Ordinal.


__Problem 2__ (16 points). Suppose in a certain area, the number of ships
per 10 by 10 kilometer region of the ocean has a Poisson distribution with
parameter 0.2.

(a) What is the probability of observing 5 ships in one 10 by 10 kilometer
region?

$p(y) = \frac{e^{-\mu}\mu^y}{y!}=\frac{e^{-0.2} 0.2^ 5}{5!}= `r dpois(5, 0.2)`, \mu = 0.2, y=5$


(b) What is the probability of observing no more than 5 ships in a 100 by
100 kilometer region?

There are 100 (independent) 10x10 $km^2$ region in a 100x100 $km^2$  region, number of ships in each of the 100 regions has possion distrubiton $\mu = 0.2$ $(X_i)$. The sum $X_1 +...+ X_{100}$ has the poisson distribuiton with mean $\mu_{total} = \mu_1 + ... + \mu_{100} =  `r 100 * 0.2`$.

$p(y)= `r sum(dpois(1:5, 20))`$


__Problem 3__ (18 points). When the 2000 General Social Survey asked subjects
whether they would be willing to accept cuts in their standard of living to
protect the environment, 344 of 1170 subjects said Yes. Note: Some helpful
R and SAS code is provided on ANGEL. See hw1. R and hw1_ help. SAS .

(a) Estimate the population proportion who would say Yes.

estimated population proportion: $\hat{p}= \frac{344}{1170} = `r 344/1170`$

estimated standard error: $\hat{SE} = \frac{\sqrt{\hat{p} (1 - \hat{p})}}{\sqrt{n}} = `r (sqrt( (344/1170) * (1 - (344/1170)))) /sqrt(1170)`$

(b) Conduct significance test to determine whether a majority of the population
would say Yes. Report and interpret the p-value.

$H_0: p <= 0.5$

$H_A: p> 0.5$

$Z = \frac{\overline{p} - 0.5}{\hat{SE}}= \frac{0.02940171 - 0.05}{0.0133196}= `r (0.2940171 - 0.5)/0.0133196`$

${p-value} = `r pnorm((0.2940171 - 0.5)/ 0.0133196)` < 0.05$

(c) Construct and interpret 99% confidence interval for the population proportion
who would say Yes. Here you should construct a classical confi-
dence interval, i.e. based on Wald test; later we will see some problems
with this approach

$\hat{p}= \frac{344}{1170} = `r 344/1170`$

$\hat{SE} = \frac{\sqrt{\hat{p} (1 - \hat{p})}}{\sqrt{n}} = `r (sqrt( (344/1170) * (1 - (344/1170)))) /sqrt(1170)`$

(`r 0.2940171 - qnorm(.99) * 0.0133196` , `r 0.2940171 + qnorm(.99) * 0.0133196`)
